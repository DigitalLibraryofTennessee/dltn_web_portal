## Workflows

### Report a Bug


To report a bug you should [open an issue in the dltn_web_portal repository](https://github.com/DigitalLibraryofTennessee/dltn_web_portal/issues/new) that summarizes the bug. Prepend the label "Bug:" to the title of the issue.

In order to help us understand and fix the bug it would be great if you could provide us with:

1. The steps to reproduce the bug. This includes information about e.g. the Islandora version you were using along with the versions of stack components.
2. The expected behavior.
3. The actual, incorrect behavior.

Feel free to search the issue queue for existing issues (aka tickets) that already describe the problem; if there is such a ticket please add your information as a comment.

**If you want to provide a pull along with your bug report:**

That is great! In this case please send us a pull request as described in the section _Create a pull request_  below.

### Create a pull request

Take a look at [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request). In a nutshell you need to:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repository to your personal or institutional GitHub account (depending on the CLA you are working under). Be cautious of which branches you work from though (you'll want to base your work off master, or for Drupal modules use the most recent version branch). See [Fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for detailed instructions.
2. Commit any changes to your fork.
3. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) using the [pull request template](https://github.com/DigitalLibraryofTennessee/dltn_web_portal/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) to the DLTN GitHub repository that you forked in step 1.  If your pull request is related to an existing issue -- for instance, because you reported a [bug/issue](https://github.com/DigitalLibraryofTennessee/dltn_web_portal/issues) earlier -- prefix the title of your pull request with the corresponding issue number (e.g. `issue-123: ...`). Please also include a reference to the issue in the description of the pull. This can be done by using '#' plus the issue number like so '#123', also try to pick an appropriate name for the branch in which you're issuing the pull request from.
